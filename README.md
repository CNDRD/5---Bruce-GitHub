Bruce is now being automatically deployed straight from this repo!

`r6sapi` is my very own fork of [r6sapi](https://github.com/billy-yoyo/RainbowSixSiege-Python-API) by [Will](https://github.com/billy-yoyo)  
I just made it work and added a bunch of shit in my weird way. But you know what they say, "If it works it ain't stupid", so yeah.  

Bruce is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
